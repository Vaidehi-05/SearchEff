Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models. Popular algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.

::idea Investigate ensemble methods like random forests and gradient boosting.

Unsupervised learning identifies hidden patterns in data without labels. Examples include k-means clustering and PCA.

@to-do Write explanation of bias-variance tradeoff with visual examples.

Deep learning uses neural networks to model complex relationships. Backpropagation is key to training these models efficiently.

@to-revise Activation functions: sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, leaky ReLU.

::idea Add notes on reinforcement learning â€” agent-environment interaction.

Cross-validation helps in estimating model performance. Overfitting and underfitting are common challenges in ML pipelines.
