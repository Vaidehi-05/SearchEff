The quicksort algorithm is a divide-and-conquer technique. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. @to-do Implement randomized pivot selection.

Merge sort is a stable sort, especially useful for linked lists. Its time complexity is always O(n log n). Compared to quicksort, it's not in-place but it's predictable. 

::idea Compare merge sort and quicksort on linked lists vs arrays.

Heap sort, on the other hand, is not stable but has good worst-case performance. @to-revise Binary heap operations: insertion, deletion, and heapify.

In practice, quicksort is faster for arrays due to locality of reference. In some languages, built-in sort is implemented using Timsort, which combines merge sort and insertion sort.

@to-do Research introsort and its hybrid approach.
